Hackathons, hackathons, and more hackathons. After roughly two weeks in the Bay Area, the [Scaphold](https://scaphold.io) team’s been spending time in rooms full of technology enthusiasts.

Huge shoutout to AT&THacks and BASEHacks for hosting phenomenal events to spur the innovative culture! We met some of the brightest and most passionate people in the industry, helping them create their next big ideas.
> #Bottom line: hackers *love* using Scaphold to build their apps! We gave a few talks and demos on how the platform works, from teaching GraphQL to empowering eager hackers to integrate this new technology into their apps.

We found that most hackers were extremely receptive to the idea of using GraphQL over familiar REST APIs. More telling is the fact that they were willing to part from using popular tools like Firebase and Kinvey to leveraging the power of GraphQL with Scaphold since there were no SDKs that they needed to grapple with.

The nature of the language and the GraphQL server gives developers a chance to focus on what really matters to them most — their app. The hackathons demonstrated that in a small span of time, even setting up complex data models that normally would’ve taken hours were dwindled down to minutes.

Apps that modeled and stored Bitcoin block chains, chat bot apps, and music apps were able to build on Scaphold’s GraphQL backend-as-a-service to win prizes in these competitive events. We’re excited to see how they move forward with their ideas and we’re supporting them along the way. If you have a cool app idea that you want to build, reach out to us on [Slack](http://slack.scaphold.io). We’ll be happy to help!

As a result of their feedback, there have also been major improvements to the platform, from a table view explorer, auto-generator for GraphQL queries, as well as File types for media-rich apps. Check them out in the “What’s New” tab on the Scaphold dashboard.

Let us know what you think!
